Sorry if something is not cool, this is my first git repo and first tinymce 3.x plugin. 

The plugin is a quick way i created for some of clients so they can copypaste embed codes for videos on their websites without having to understand what HTML is. 

1) So copy the plugin to the TinyMCE plugin folder.

2) Enable the plugin by placing cfhtmlsnippet in "plugins" configuration so it is something like this
plugins: "style,advimage,[...],cfhtmlsnippet"
and add cfhtmlsnippet to the toolbar under theme options if you have custom toolbar like this:
theme_advanced_buttons1 : 'bold,italic,underline,strikethrough,[...],cfhtmlsnippet'

Usage
Nothing hard - click on the snippet button (rotatet <br/> tag), insert snippet (usually youtube, google, facebook or twitter snippet) and it will be instantly inserted where the cursor was.
